# COVID--19-Project
# 1. Data Collection
- Use publicly available COVID-19 datasets, such as from:

- Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset ; https://catalog.ourworldindata.org/garden/covid/latest/compact/compact.csv

- Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 dataset ; https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

# 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Load data using Pandas.

- Handle missing values, convert date columns, and filter by countries of interest.

- Work with NumPy arrays to compute metrics like rolling averages.

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze trends in:

- Daily and cumulative cases/deaths

- Case fatality rate

- Vaccination progress

- Calculate statistical measures:

- Mean, median, standard deviation

- Correlation between vaccinations and cases

# 4. Visualization
- Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create:

- Line plots of cases over time

- Bar charts of top countries by vaccination rate

- Heatmaps of case correlation by country

- Pie charts of case distribution by continent

# 5. Insights and Reporting
- Summarize findings with markdown or Jupyter Notebook cells.

- Optional: Generate a basic PDF/HTML report using Python libraries.
